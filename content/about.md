## Why Spendly?

Let's be honest - most finance apps on the Play Store are either drowning in ads, demand a hefty subscription fee, or overcomplicate something that should be simple: tracking where your money goes.

Spendly is my answer to that frustration. A no-nonsense personal finance tracker built for individuals who value their privacy and simplicity.

## What Makes It Different?

- **Fully Offline** - Your data never leaves your device. No servers, no cloud sync, no tracking.
- **Privacy First** - What you spend is nobody's business but yours.
- **Zero Ads, Zero Bloat** - Just the features you need, nothing more.
- **Own Your Data** - Import and export via JSON. Your data, your control.

## Current Status

Spendly is currently in development. I'm focused on building something useful without the usual baggage that comes with finance apps.

## Who's Behind This?

Hi, I'm [Lallu Anthoor](https://linkedin.com/in/lallu). I built Spendly because I got tired of choosing between privacy and functionality in personal finance apps.
