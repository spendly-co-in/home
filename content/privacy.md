# Privacy Policy for Spendly

**Last Updated:** December 12, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how **Spendly** ("we," "our," or "the App") handles your data.

We believe that your financial data belongs to you. **Spendly is a strictly offline application.** We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal financial entry data on any external servers.

### 1. Data Collection and Usage

**1.1. Personal Data**
We do not collect, transmit, or sell any personal information. All expense logs, categories, and budget details you enter into Spendly are stored locally on your device's internal memory.

**1.2. Internet Access**
The App does not require or request Internet permission (`android.permission.INTERNET`) for its core functionality. This ensures that your financial data physically cannot leave your device through the App.

**1.3. On-Device AI features**
Spendly may utilize on-device Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning models to provide features such as automatic categorization or spending insights. These models run entirely locally on your device's processor. No data is sent to the cloud for processing, training, or analysis.

### 2. Third-Party Services & Telemetry

While the App itself does not track you, it is distributed via the **Google Play Store**.

**2.1. Google Play Services**
Google Play may collect aggregate, anonymous usage data (such as crash logs, install timestamps, and device types) to help us monitor the technical stability of the App. This data is governed by Google’s own Privacy Policy and is not linked to your specific financial entries within Spendly.
* [Google Play Services Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

### 3. App Permissions

To function correctly, Spendly may request specific permissions. These are used solely for the purposes listed below:

* **Storage / Photos & Media:** Required only if you choose to export/backup your data to a file or attach receipts to an expense.
* **Notifications:** Required only to send you local reminders to log your expenses. These notifications are generated by the app on your device and are not sent from a server.

### 4. Data Retention and Deletion

Since we do not store your data on our servers, we cannot delete it for you. You have full control over your data:
* **Retention:** Data is retained on your device as long as the App is installed.
* **Deletion:** Uninstalling the App or clearing the App Data in your phone's settings will permanently delete all data stored within Spendly. Please ensure you have backed up any important data before doing so.

### 5. Children’s Privacy

Spendly does not knowingly collect data from children under the age of 13. Since the app functions offline and collects no data, it is safe for all ages, but we do not target children as our primary audience.

### 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
